As suggested by the presentation(link above), BOHR and MOM are
heuristics that were popular until mid nineties, by late nineties
they were obsolete. 

With reference to

We will implement both JS-OS and DLIS since it is uncertain that which will
perform faster on FPGA/hardware as contrasted to evidence suggest in the paper,
in which case experiments were made on software implemented solvers.

The only advantage MOM has is that it may be slightly easier in hardware
implementation.

VSIDS is a heuristic which can be used only when the algorithm uses
clause based learning.
